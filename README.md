# :cook: Cooking Collective :cook:
Last updated December 2022.

## Overview
The cooking collective is my final project for Montana Code School and provides a simple way to share recipes with others. 

My bare bare bones MVP still needs a lot of work to be production ready, with some notable planned changes below.
:pie: Switch from MockAPI to Node.js, with a potential to also incorporate firebase for individualized accounts. Recipes can be stored on a user to user basis as opposed to generally available

:pie: Mobile and accessibility formatting, in addition to improving formatting beyond bare bones CSS/Chakra blend and importing font and color theme into Chakra

:pie: Many many tweaks and adjustments to components, including further building out recipe metadata and formatting, build drawers and inline editing vs modals, etc...

Hoping to tackle this in the first half of 2023, but depends how busy I am with work!
